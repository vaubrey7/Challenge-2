        <p id="About Me">I am a Full Stack Engineer, Father of 6, yes thats not a typo, it's 6. 3 of which are adopted. I am an avid outdoorsman my brother runs a tour Utah company Beehive Adventures. Which I go on some of the tours 
            with him because it's just so fun to get out and hike and see my beautiful state that is Utah. I'm primarily looking to stay here in Utah and preferably work remote. My son has a Congenital Heart Disease: Truncus Arteriosis type 2. 
            So I need to stay close the Primary Childrens Hospital we have here. We have a great team and prefer to keep them. I enjoy coin collecting. I love food! cooking it, baking it and eating it. I also follow Arsenal as a Soccer fan. I work hard, and I've 
            Worked even harder to get to where I am and I am never giving up or giving in, I can promise you that.
